* enhancement: the new option *Environment variables* allows to modify the environment variables seen by the test executables without modifying the system's global environment. Variables are provided by means of key-value pairs `Foo=Bar`, and are separated by `//||//` ([#302](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/302))
* enhancement: added some debug output to make working with settings helper files easier ([#278](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/278))
* bugfix: if the last variable's value of a settings helper file was followed by a line break, that line break would be added to the value ([#306](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/306))
* maintenance: fixed some deprecation warnings in NuGet specification ([#264](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/264))
