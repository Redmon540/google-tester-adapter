* enhancement: under certain circumstances, the VS test framework might show a test in the test explorer which can not be run any more. So far, GTA has dealed with this rare situation by logging an according warning in debug mode; the new option *Behavior for missing test results* allows to configure GTA such that it reports such tests to VS ([#295](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/295), thanks to [Cornelius Stubbe](https://github.com/c-stubbe) for testing)
* donations: thanks to Nicholas - I really appreciate it!
